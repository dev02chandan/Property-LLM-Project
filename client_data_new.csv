Troubleshooting FIREPLACE: 

There is a remote for the fireplace that should be sitting on the coffee table .You will press the off button and the flame up button (the two buttons with the lines and spark drawn between them) at the same time to ignite the pilot. Then you will press the flame up Nd down buttons to control the flame.

There should be a reset button on the remote box located on the right hand side of the log set in the fireplace. You are welcome to reset it. You will also want to check that the remote box is set to auto or remote and not manual. There is also a gas valve in that same area that you will want to make sure is parallel with the gas line. If you are still not able to get it working after trying all of these troubleshooting steps we can schedule someone to assist you with it tomorrow.
